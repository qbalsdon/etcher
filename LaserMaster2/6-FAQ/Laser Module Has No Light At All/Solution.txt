Usually, if laser module is burned (the electric conductor was striken through.), 
there would be no light at "Minimum Brightness",  but should be visible light at "Medium Brightness", "Maximum Brightness".

Could you please do two steps to make sure the problem?


1. Could you please check the wires connection on the pinboard?
To exclude the issue of wrong wiring.


2. Wires connection is correct, but still no laser.
Could you please unplug the laser moduel and then, measure the voltage between the PWM and GND?
Turn on the laser and click the "Maximum Brightness", and see whether the voltage would be changed.

If it not changed, the terminal on motherboard is broken, need to repalce teh motherboard.
If it changed, you cuold measure the PWM on pinboard too.
If it not changed, the terminal on pinboard is broken, need to replace the pinboard.
If it changed, the controllerboard on laser module should be burned and need to replace.
