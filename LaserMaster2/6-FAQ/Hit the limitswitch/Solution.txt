If the limit swtich cannot stop the motor, the issue is that the limit switch doesn't work.

1. Y limit switch doesn't work.
Solution: Usually, it's because of the loose cable, please check the wires connection bettween the limit switch and the motherboard.
If wires connection is ok, please check, whether the Y limit swtich is in good condition.

2. X limit switch doesn't work.
Solution: please check the wires connection bettween the pinboard and the motherboard.
If wires connection is ok, please check, whether the black button of X limit is broken, if it's broken, please repalce a new pinboard(with X limit switch).

If both of the wires connection and the limit swtiche are in good condition, the issue may be on the port of the limit switch on the motherboard.
And then, it need to repalce a new motherboard.
