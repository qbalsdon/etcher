If your laser module cannot engrave or cut.

Please use LaserGRBL to do a test:
In the menu of "Laser Control",  there're 3 options "Minimum Brightness", "Medium Brightness", "Maximum Brightness".

1. Please turn on the "Laser" button and click the "Minimum Brightness" immediately.
Whether the visible light comes out at "Minimum Brightness"?

2. Please turn on the "Laser" button and click the "Medium Brightness" immediately, 
Whether the visible light comes out at "Medium Brightness"?

If you got both of 1 and 2. it means the laser diode is burned, and you need to replace a new laser module.

PS. It couldn't engrave/cut on reflective mirror surface, then the laser diode wouldn't be burned by the reflected laser.


By the way, if there is no any light, at all of "Minimum Brightness", "Medium Brightness", "Maximum Brightness"
Please check the PWM LED (the blue one) of the laser module, whether the blue light is lighting!
If the blue LED light doesn't light, please don't power on the machine again.
Could you please take a photo of the wires connection on the pinboard, at the acrylic holder of the left side of the X-axis.

All three brightnesses have lights, it means the laser diode could work fine.
Could you please use cotton swabs and alcohol​ to clean the lens of the laser module to give a try?
If still not work, could you please submit a ticket here:
