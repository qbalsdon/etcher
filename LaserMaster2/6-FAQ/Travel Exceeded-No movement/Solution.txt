If the motor don't move + homing failed, it means it's not caused by bad limit switch. 
Mostly possible, it's the wrong firmware assembled.

And one more question, when you power on the machine, would the machine home successfully?
If so, it's absolutly the wrong firmware installed, and then, you need to re-install the firmware.

Please download the correct firmware and instruction at:
